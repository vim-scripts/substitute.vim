 Visual and normal mode mappings for easy access to substitutions with the
 s/// command.

 This script will make it easy to replace the word under the cursor, or the
 visually selected text across the whole file. If more than one line is
 selected the substitution will only occur on the selected lines.

Default key mappings:

   ;;  Perform substitution across the whole file.

   ;'  The same, but prompt for each substitution.

 Pressing <C-R><C-R> will insert the text being replaced into the command line
 window.

 When the search and replace has completed the cursor can be returned to where
 the search started by jumping to mark ' (pressing '' or `').

Note:

 - The contents of a register (default "9) is overwritten
