 Visual and normal mode mappings for easy access to substitutions with the
 s/// command.

 This script will make it easy to replace the word under the cursor, or the
 visually selected text across the whole file. If more than one line is
 selected the substitution will only occur on the selected lines.

substitute.vim provides the following two mappings for both visual and normal
mode:

   ;;  Run :substitute on the current buffer without prompting.

   ;'  The same, only prompt for each.

   ';  Perform substitution on the lines that match a multi-repeat
       expression, prompting for each.

These mappings can be changed as specified in the following section.

It is also possible to press <C-R><C-R> while in command line mode to insert
the text that is replaced into the commandline.

 When the search and replace has completed the cursor can be returned to where
 the search started by jumping to mark ' (pressing '' or `').
