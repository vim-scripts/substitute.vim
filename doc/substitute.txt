1. Purpose                                                  *substitute-purpose*

The substitute.vim script provides shortcuts for replacing
the text under the cursor, or visually selected text in the
current file.  It is essentially a shortcut to the vim built
in substitute command; see |:substitute|.

There are two mappings defined: one which will replace text
across the whole file without prompting, and one which will
prompt for every replacement.

It should be noted that this script modifies a register when
one of the mappings is executed.  This register defaults to
"9 but it can be changed; see |substitute-config|.

================================================================================
2. Key mappings                                                *substitute-maps*

substitute.vim provides the following two mappings for both
visual and normal mode:

   ;;  Perform substitution without prompting.

   ;'  Perform substitution and prompt for each.

These mappings can be changed as specified in the following
section.

It is also possible to press <C-R><C-R> while in command
line mode to insert the text that is replaced into the 
commandline.

3. Configuration                                             *substitute-config*

To change the default mappings to mappings that you like
better you can change the value of the following variables
before sourcing the substitute.vim script:

                                                             *substitute-prompt*
   let g:substitute_PromptMap = ";'"

This variable contains the key sequence for invoking
substitution that should prompt each time a match is
found.

                                                           *substitute-noprompt*
   let g:substitute_NoPromptMap = ';;'

This variable specifies the key sequence for invoking
substitution without prompting.

                                                           *substitute-register*
To change the register that is overwritten when executing
one of the provided mappings you can change the value of
this variable:

   let g:substitute_Register = '9'

4. History

   1.1  - Added use of GetLatestVimScripts and fixed a small bug. 

   1.04 - Added a separate helpfile and the possibility of customizing 
          mappings and the register that the script uses.
   
   1.03 - Simplified the mapping a bit. Marking register ' was not needed.
   
   1.02 - Changed the meaning of the ;' mapping, and added <unique> to the map
          definitions.  Added the Escape function so $ and ^ are only escaped
          when they appear at the beginning, or at the end.  Also added
          cpoptions check and <SID> stuff.
   
   1.01 - Removed unuseful mapcheck.
